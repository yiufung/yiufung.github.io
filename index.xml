      <title>Pure Emacs-Lisp Init Skeleton</title>

      <description>Last year I rewrote my configuration from scratch as I migrated from Spacemacs to vanilla Emacs. At first I chose to use Org babel, the literate programming style. After a while, however, I find it not as handy as expected:
 At least 2 files are to be maintained (init.el &amp;amp; config.org), which is unnecessary complexity init.el needs to tangle the whole Org file for every single change, which gets slow as code blocks accumulated, and gets annoying when experimenting with new package Debugging is not intuitive.</description>

      <description>This post describes my method to learn Emacs native keybindings from an ex-Vimmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension from a Reddit post.
Evil-mode journey My Emacs journey started with Spacemacs. At that time, I had the misconception that Emacs has lengthy and incomprehensible keybindings, so without a second thought, I chose to go with Vim-bindings, which I used for 6 years and even read a book about. Spacemacs is surely a great project, opening up all the goodies of Emacs to a Vimmer.</description>
