      <title>Org-mode Hidden Gems: Document Structure</title>

      <description>Recently I started to read Org-mode manual, and it surprises me there are so many useful options/commands I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of even after using it daily for the past year, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of the findings here.
Each option/command is accompanied with a GIF to demonstrate its usefulness. Settings are based on my preference, but as the old saying goes, &amp;ldquo;a man&amp;rsquo;s Emacs is his own castle&amp;rdquo;, so do customize it for your own good.</description>

      <title>Pure Emacs-Lisp Init Skeleton</title>

      <description>Last year I rewrote my configuration from scratch as I migrated from Spacemacs to vanilla Emacs. For config style, I chose Org Babel - which normally involves using a short Lisp file (init.el) to tangle and load actual config in Org mode (config.org) - for its readability and easy navigation. After a while, however, I find it not as handy as expected:
 At least 2 files are to be maintained, which adds unnecessary complexity config.</description>

      <title>Learning Emacs Key Bindings</title>

      <description>This post describes my method to learn Emacs native keybindings from an ex-Vimmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension from a Reddit post.
Evil-mode journey My Emacs journey started with Spacemacs. At that time, I had the misconception that Emacs has lengthy and incomprehensible keybindings, so without a second thought, I chose to go with Vim-bindings, which I used for 6 years and even read a book about. Spacemacs is surely a great project, opening up all the goodies of Emacs to a Vimmer.</description>
