      <description>Last year as I migrated from Spacemacs to vanilla Emacs, I rewrote my configuration from scratch. At first I chose to use Org babel as I have grown accustomed to Org-mode already. However, I find it not quite handy after a while:
 At least 2 files are to be maintained (init.el &amp;amp; config.org), which adds unnecessary complexity init.el needs to tangle Org file with every changes. It gets slow as new packages are added Debugging is not intuitive.</description>

      <description>This post describes my method to learn Emacs native keybindings from an ex-Vimmer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension from a Reddit post.
Evil-mode journey My Emacs journey started with Spacemacs. At that time, I had the misconception that Emacs has lengthy and incomprehensible keybindings, so without a second thought, I chose to go with Vim-bindings, which I used for 6 years and even read a book about. Spacemacs is surely a great project, opening up all the goodies of Emacs to a Vimmer.</description>
